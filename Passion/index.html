            Here, I hope to create a personal page which contains my casual life.<br>
            Such as dance, workourm and longboarding. I wanna share my life with<br>
            you guys and what other sides of me you could find out. My life is not<br>
            about work. What I treasure more is off the work. I have many interest.<br>
            I love to explore new things, and train myself into a better version of<br>
            myself. I know this is a bit crazy. But it's the real me.
